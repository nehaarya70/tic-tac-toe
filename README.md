TIC TAC TOE

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who 
succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of 
good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It 
is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 
essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations 
and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space.
